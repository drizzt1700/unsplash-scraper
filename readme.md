#Unsplash Scraper

##What it do
This simple script scrapes the ten newest images on unsplash.com, an attribution-free pretty image tumblr, a great resource for FEDs and designers.  This way you won't have to go through and download this week's images manually, just run the script.

This is also my first web scraper in node.  Fun stuff.
